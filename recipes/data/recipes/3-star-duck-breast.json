    "steps": [
      "Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).",
      "Score the skin of the duck breast in a criss-cross pattern and season both sides with salt and black pepper.",
      "In a cold oven-proof skillet, place the duck breast skin-side down and turn the heat to medium. Sear for about 6-8 minutes until the skin is crispy, rendering the fat.",
      "Once the skin is golden and crispy, flip the duck breasts and sear the other side for about 2 minutes. Then transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and cook for 8-10 minutes for medium-rare.",
      "While the duck is cooking, prepare the cherry gastrique. In a saucepan, combine the granulated sugar and a splash of water over medium heat until the sugar dissolves and turns caramel in color.",
      "Add the cherries and cook for 2-3 minutes until softened. Add the red wine vinegar and cook for another 5 minutes until the mixture thickens slightly. Strain if desired and keep warm.",
      "To prepare the truffle potato purée, boil the chopped potatoes in salted water until tender (about 15 minutes). Drain and return to the pot.",
      "Add the heavy cream and truffle oil, then blend until smooth and creamy. Season with salt to taste.",
      "Once the duck is done, let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing it thinly on the bias.",
      "To plate, add a dollop of truffle potato purée to the center of the plate, arrange sliced duck breast beautifully on top, and drizzle with the cherry gastrique. Garnish with fresh chives."
